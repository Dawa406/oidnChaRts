# Geolines Map

Our sample dataset is included in the library, `data_geo_lines_plot` and comprises a set of send-receive coordinates. The `geo_lines_plot` function requires a dataset with at least the following columns:

- start.latitude
- start.longitude
- end.latitude
- end.longitude

```{r}
library(oidnChaRts)
head(data_geo_lines_plot)
```

Hat tip to [http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/interactive-flow-visualization-in-r.html](http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/interactive-flow-visualization-in-r.html) for the `geospheres` library which computes [great circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle).

## Leaflet

### Basic Example

The minimal number of arguments required for `geo_line_map` are as follows:

```{r}
library(leaflet)
geo_lines_plot(data_geo_lines_plot, 
              library = "leaflet")
```

There are additional arguments that may control the `line.options` and `termini.options` (the dots at each end of the geo_line)

```{r}
geo_lines_plot(data_geo_lines_plot, 
              library = "leaflet",
              line.options = list(weight = 3))
```

The leaflet map produced by `geo_lines_plot` can be used in pipe chains like any other leaflet map:

```{r}
geo_lines_plot(data_geo_lines_plot, 
              library = "leaflet",
              line.options = list(weight = 3)) %>%
  addProviderTiles("Stamen.Watercolor")
```

### Tooltips

The `geo_lines_plot` function has been designed for tooltips to be easily added to the lines of termini, in the example below a popup will show when a geo_line is clicked.

```{r}
label_journey <- function(start.location = NA, end.location = NA){
  paste0(
    "<p>start: ", start.location,
    "</p>",
    "<p>end: ", end.location
  )
}
geo_lines_plot(data_geo_lines_plot, 
              library = "leaflet",
              line.popup = ~label_journey(start.location, end.location),
              line.options = list(weight = 3)) %>%
  addProviderTiles("Stamen.Watercolor")
```


# Choropleth from points

Our sample dataset is included in the library, `data_geo_points` and comprises a set of coordinates . The `geo_lines_plot` function requires a dataset with at least the following columns:

- start.latitude
- start.longitude
- end.latitude
- end.longitude

```{r}
library(oidnChaRts)
head(data_geo_lines_plot)
