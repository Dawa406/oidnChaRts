A collection of functions for building generic interactive `htmlwidget` visualisations, primarily to compare library "A" vs "B" but also usable in their own right.

Functions are in general called as follows:

```{r geo_lines_map, eval=FALSE}
library(oidnChaRts)
geo_lines_map(data_geo_lines_map, 
              library = "leaflet")
```
